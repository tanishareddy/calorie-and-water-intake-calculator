 Calorie and Water Intake Tracker
                
1. Brief Description of Project
The Calorie and Water Intake Tracker is a terminal-based mini-project developed in C that helps users
monitor their daily calorie consumption and water intake. It allows users to log meals, calculate total
calories and track hydration levels. It also allows the user to store new items and their calories for
future reference.

2. Purpose / Goal
The purpose of this project is to help users keep track of their daily calorie consumption and water
intake to support a healthier lifestyle. The goal is to enable users to stay healthy, prevent overeating,
and maintain a balanced diet by monitoring their food and hydration habits.

3. Usefulness / Benefit
● For Users: Helps maintain a healthy lifestyle by easily tracking daily calorie intake and water
consumption.
● For Diet-Conscious Individuals: Supports weight management, portion control, and balanced
eating habits.
● For Fitness Enthusiasts: Complements workout routines by aligning nutrition and hydration
● For Health Professionals: Provides a basic tool to encourage patient accountability and
promote healthier daily routines.

Integration Testing:
Ensure proper flow between modules — e.g., meal logging should update calorie summaries
accurately.
System Testing:
Validate overall system behavior — input, calculations, and summary reporting.
User Acceptance Testing:
Test with sample users to ensure ease of use, clarity of output, and alignment with real-world
tracking needs.

7. Expected Interaction Interface and Sample Use Cases
Interaction Interface:
● terminal-based UI with menu-driven navigation
● Input through simple text prompts
● Option to display output at the end of every program.

Sample Use Cases:
User runs the program → Goes to menu → Updates daily calorie and water goals → Saves changes→ Tracker reflects new targets
